## What is PGKhata?

PGKhata is a web-based PG (Paying Guest) and hostel management software built for PG owners across India. It solves two core problems: the chaos of manual rent collection, and tenant records that live nowhere in particular.

PG owners across India run a genuinely hard, high-touch business on WhatsApp messages, notebooks, and memory. Every month, the same owner manually types out rent and electricity reminders to 20-30 different tenants, one chat at a time, then tries to remember who has actually paid. Tenant records, address proof, deposit amounts, room history — all scattered across a register and a phone gallery. This is hours of repeated, invisible work every single month, for a business that already runs on thin margins.

**PGKhata eliminates this chaos.** It takes a PG owner from adding a tenant to sending a fully itemized WhatsApp bill, in minutes, without asking the tenant to install anything or create any login.

## The MVP — What It Is and What It Isn't

### The Founder's MVP Definition

From `intention.txt`:

> A tool that takes a PG owner from adding a tenant to sending a fully itemized WhatsApp bill with a working UPI QR code, in minutes, without asking the tenant to install anything or create any login. Nothing more than that, until that part is genuinely solid.

### The Core MVP Loop

The MVP is deliberately narrow:

1. **Add a tenant** — Record tenant details, assign to a bed
2. **Generate a bill** — One-click monthly bill with rent + electricity + other charges
3. **Send via WhatsApp** — Itemized bill delivered directly to tenant's WhatsApp
4. **Track payment** — Simple paid vs pending view

**That's it.** Everything else waits until the core is proven with real owners paying real money.

### What the MVP Is NOT

The founder is clear about what doesn't come first:

- **Not vacancy management** — Not solving the empty-bed problem yet
- **Not staff management** — Not a multi-user system yet
- **Not a tenant app** — Tenants don't need to install anything
- **Not automated reconciliation** — Payment recording stays honest and manual until a proper gateway exists
- **Not a platform** — Not trying to be the Uber of PGs
- **Not venture-scale** — A handful of PG owners in Noida who stop dreading the first of the month

### The MVP Bar (from phases.md)

> A real PG owner, on real data, adds a tenant and sends a bill that arrives on WhatsApp; the tenant pays; the system marks it paid without the owner touching it.

This is the exit criterion for Phase 2. Until this is demonstrated with real owners, everything else is scope beyond a product that does not yet do its one job.

### What Success Looks Like (Honestly)

> A handful of PG owners in Noida who stop dreading the first of the month, because pgkhata.com already did the part they used to do by hand. That is the bar before anything else matters.

## Why We Are Different from Competitors

### The #1 Differentiator: 100% FREE

**No competitor offers free software.** This is the ultimate differentiator.

| Platform | Pricing |
|----------|---------|
| **PGKhata** | **₹0 forever** |
| RentOk | Custom (Gold/Silver tiers) |
| PG Master | Custom pricing |
| My PG Manager | ₹159/month flat |
| BTRoomer | Custom pricing |
| PG Manager | ₹3,600/year (₹300/month) |
| Niketan | Custom pricing |

**The Jio Playbook:** Maximum market penetration first. Monetization comes later through ecosystem services (tenant marketplace, financial services, supplier network), not through charging PG owners.

### 8 Reasons PGKhata Wins

#### 1. FREE Forever (vs ₹159–₹300/month)

Every competitor charges. PGKhata doesn't. For a PG owner running on thin margins, this is the difference between trying software and not trying it at all. No credit card required. No trial period. No "free tier" with artificial limits. Everything is free.

#### 2. Web-First (vs Mobile-First)

Most competitors are Android apps. PGKhata works on any device with a browser — phone, tablet, laptop, desktop. No app store downloads. No update prompts. Works on the owner's existing device immediately.

#### 3. WhatsApp-First Tenant Delivery

Owners can send itemized bills and payment reminders through the channel tenants already use. Tenants receive the information without installing another app or creating a separate login.

#### 4. Modern Tech Stack

Next.js 16, TypeScript, proper TDD with 324 tests passing. Competitors use legacy PHP/Java stacks. PGKhata is built on technology that's actively maintained, secure, and performant.

#### 5. Superior Billing Engine

PGKhata's billing is more sophisticated than any competitor:
- **Line-item billing** with configurable charge types
- **Advance payments** with apply/forfeit workflows
- **Auto-allocate** payments across multiple invoices
- **Invoice voiding** without data loss
- **Promised payment dates** with late fee suspension
- **Idempotent operations** — double-submit safe

#### 6. Approval Workflow

Both public signup AND manual tenant creation go through owner approval. Most competitors auto-activate tenants, giving owners less control over who moves in.

#### 7. Financial Safety Nets

- **Invoice voiding** — Cancel mistakes without deleting data
- **Promised payment dates** — Track tenant commitments
- **Checkout preview** — See the full financial picture before a tenant leaves
- **Security deposit lifecycle** — Track held, refunded, and partial refunds

#### 8. Granular Permissions

Module-level access control (tenants, billing, expenses, reports, structure) — only Niketan has this level of granularity. PGKhata lets owners give staff access to exactly what they need, nothing more.

## Business Model: The Jio Playbook

### Core Principle

**No premium tiers. No per-tenant fees. No hidden charges. Everything is free, forever.**

This isn't a temporary strategy or a "get users then monetize" bait-and-switch. The Jio playbook is about maximum market penetration creating an ecosystem that monetizes through services, not subscriptions.

### Future Monetization (Ecosystem, Not Subscriptions)

1. **Tenant marketplace** — Premium features for tenants (rental history, credit building)
2. **Financial services** — Working capital loans, insurance for PG owners
3. **Supplier network** — Food, cleaning, maintenance vendor marketplace
4. **Advertising** — PG-related services targeting owners and tenants
5. **Data insights** — Anonymized market data for real estate investors
6. **White-label** — Custom branded solutions for large PG chains

### Why This Works

- **Low switching cost** — Free removes the #1 barrier to adoption
- **Network effects** — More owners → more tenants → more valuable ecosystem
- **Data moat** — Aggregated PG market data becomes valuable over time
- **Trust building** — Free builds trust; monetize later through adjacent services

## Growth Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Loop (Current)

The MVP is done. The core billing loop works. Now it needs to be proven with real owners.

**Remaining work:**
- Official Meta WhatsApp Cloud API integration (template approval, business verification)
- Payment gateway with webhooks for automated reconciliation
- Fix cross-tenant security defects in legacy code
- Test with real PG owners in Noida

### Phase 2: Growth Features

1. **Tenant Mobile App (PWA)** — View payments, submit complaints on phone
2. **Property Website** — Auto-generated landing page per PG with rooms, amenities, photos
3. **Lead Management** — Inquiry to check-in pipeline, WhatsApp follow-up, visit scheduling

### Phase 3: Differentiation

4. **AI Assistant** — Natural language PG queries ("Who hasn't paid rent?")
5. **Zero Deposit Insurance** — Partnership with insurance provider to cover security deposit
6. **Offline Mode** — PWA with service workers for offline access

### Phase 4: Platform

7. **Attendance Tracking** — Staff check-in/out
8. **Food Schedule** — Hostel mess management
9. **Police Verification** — Regional compliance feature

## What's NOT in This Product (Yet)

Being honest about what PGKhata doesn't do:

| Feature | Status | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Tenant mobile app | Planned (PWA) | Tenants don't need to install anything for the core loop |
| Automated payment reconciliation | Planned (requires gateway) | UPI provides no webhook; need Razorpay/QRCodes |
| SMS notifications | Planned | WhatsApp covers 95% of use cases in India |
| Offline mode | Planned (PWA) | Most PG owners have reliable internet |
| AI assistant | Planned | Core billing loop is more important than natural language queries |
| Attendance tracking | Planned | Staff management exists; attendance is a separate concern |
| Food schedule | Planned | Niche feature for hostel mess management |
| Police verification | Planned | Regional compliance feature |

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Features complete | 30/30 (100% Niketan parity) |
| Test coverage | 324 tests passing |
| Database tables | 23 |
| API endpoints | 60+ |
| Migrations applied | 16 |
| Price | ₹0 forever |
| Competitors matched/beaten | 6/6 |
